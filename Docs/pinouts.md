# Pinouts for the connectors.

## GPIO

5v VCC, other pins named according to their 65(C)22 counterparts.  
GPIO0-GPIO15 are PA0-PB7 respectively and CA1-CB2 are named directly after their counterparts.

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
| :---: | :---: |
| VCC | GND |
| GPIO0 | CB2 |
| GPIO1 | CB1 |
| GPIO2 | CA2 |
| GPIO3 | CA1 |
| GPIO4 | GPIO15 |
| GPIO5 | GPIO14 |
| GPIO6 | GPIO13 |
| GPIO7 | GPIO12 |
| GPIO8 | GPIO11 |
| GPIO9 | GPIO10 |

## 65SIB Connector

For this connector I would refer to the 6502.org forum post for the 65 Serial Interface Bus [here](http://forum.6502.org/viewtopic.php?p=10957#p10957). However I will provide a pinout anyways.

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
| :---: | :---: |
| CONF\ | GND |
| CLK | GND |
| MOSI | GND |
| MISO | +12v |
| IRQ\ | +12v |
| SEL1\ | SEL2\ |
