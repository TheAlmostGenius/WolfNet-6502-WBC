Where can I find licensing information?  
In the Licensing folder in [Plain Text](Licensing/LICENSE), [HTML](https://thealmostgenius.geekgalaxy.com/WolfNet-6502-WBC/license.html) and [Markdown](Licensing/license.md)

Is this really free and if so how?  
I work on this project in my own time and release all files under a OSHW license. WolfNet Computers is a not for profit organisation run by me. All files needed to manufacture are there, so the only costs are for the PCB manucfacturer YOU choose  to use. :D
