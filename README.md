WolfNet 6502 WBC. (WBC - WorkBench Computer)  
Designed as a single-board computer the WN-6502-WBC is an electrical design, control and programming computer. Inspired by home computers like the [Apple II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II), many games consoles and the users of the [6502.org](http://6502.org) forums. Made using a simple design and cheap-ish, easy-to-use and easy to assemble; This computer is perfect for beginners to electronics and veterans alike.  
The first usable release will be version 2.0. This will be the case as we started at version 1.0 rather than 0.0 as this is hardware, NOT software.

FAQ:  
Why a 6502?  
Because why not? It was good enough for the [Apple I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_I), [Apple II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II), the [NES console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricoh_2A03) and many other home computers and consoles, it is a well documented processor, plus EEPROM programmers and ZIF sockets are really cheap now.

What programs(s) did you use to make the schematics and boards?  
[KiCad for Windows bundle.](https://www.kicad.org/download/windows/)

Is this really free and if so how?  
I work on this project in my own time and release all files under an [OSHW](https://www.oshwa.org) license. [WolfNet Computing](https://github.com/WolfNet-Computing) is a not for profit organisation run by [me](https://github.com/TheAlmostGenius). All files needed to manufacture are there, so the only costs are for the PCB manucfacturer YOU choose to use. :D
