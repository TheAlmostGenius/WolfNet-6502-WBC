<p>WolfNet 6502 WBC. (WBC - WorkBench Computer)<br>Designed as a single-board computer the WN-6502-WBC is an electrical design, control and programming computer. Inspired by home computers like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II">Apple II</a>, many games consoles and the users of the <a href="http://6502.org">6502.org</a> forums. Made using a simple design and cheap-ish, easy-to-use and easy to assemble; This computer is perfect for beginners to electronics and veterans alike.<br>The first usable release will be version 2.0.

<h2 id="faq-">FAQ:</h2>
