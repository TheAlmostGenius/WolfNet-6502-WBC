<p>WolfNet 6502 WBC. (WBC - WorkBench Computer)<br>Designed as a single-board computer the WN-6502-WBC is an electrical design, control and programming computer. Inspired by home computers like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II">Apple II</a>, many games consoles and the users of the <a href="http://6502.org">6502.org</a> forums. Made using a simple design and cheap-ish, easy-to-use and easy to assemble; This computer is perfect for beginners to electronics and veterans alike.<br>The first usable release will be version 2.0. This will be the case as we started at version 1.0 rather than 0.0 as this is hardware, NOT software.</p>
<h2 id="faq-">FAQ:</h2>
<p>Why a 6502?<br>Because why not? It was good enough for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_I">Apple I</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II">Apple II</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricoh_2A03">NES console</a> and many other home computers and consoles, it is a well documented processor, plus EEPROM programmers and sockets are really cheap now.</p>
<p>What programs(s) did you use to make the schematics and boards?<br><a href="https://www.kicad.org/download/windows/">KiCad for Windows bundle.</a></p>
<p>Is this really free and if so how?<br>I work on this project in my own time and release all files under an <a href="https://www.oshwa.org">OSHW</a> license. <a href="https://github.com/WolfNet-Computing">WolfNet Computing</a> is a not for profit organisation run by <a href="https://github.com/TheAlmostGenius">me</a>. All files needed to manufacture are there, so the only costs are for the PCB manucfacturer YOU choose to use. :D</p>
<p>Where can I find licensing information?<br>In the main folder in <a href="https://thealmostgenius.geekgalaxy.com/WolfNet-6502-WBC/license.html">HTML</a> and <a href="https://thealmostgenius.geekgalaxy.com/WolfNet-6502-WBC/LICENSE.md">Markdown</a></p>
<p>How do I add components or circuits to it?<br>At the moment only the 65SIB and GPIO ports are available for easily adding anything to. However there is a prototyping board in the works, this will facilitate adding components to the computer. You could also always use the KiCad libraries provided and create your own expansion card.</p>
<p>What size is the board?<br>305mm x 190mm.</p>
<p>That&#39;s a bit big for a board! What does it feature?</p>
<ul>
<li>6502 Processor.</li>
<li>Built-in Reset feature.</li>
<li>Programmable Instruction Decoder. (Use the dedicated ROM to program the instruction translation. E.g. invalid op-codes -&gt; BRK)</li>
<li><a href="http://forum.6502.org/viewtopic.php?p=10957#p10957">65SIB</a> port.</li>
<li>RS-232 port. (For PC communication.)</li>
<li>22-pin GPIO connector.</li>
<li>20/24-pin ATX compatible power connector.</li>
<li>3 processor clock speeds available. (2, 4 & 8 MHz)</li>
<li>Bank switched RAM. (16 banks.)</li>
<li>Bank switched ROM. (16 banks, 1 shared.)</li>
<li>Processor bus expansion slots. (To be used as a slot for add-on cards that are added straight to the board. NO CABLE! That includes you Sir Richard Branson. xD)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="reasons-">Reasons for design choices:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Programmable Instruction Decoder allows the user to translate instructions to other instructions outside of the processor and under the users control.</li>
<li><a href="http://forum.6502.org/viewtopic.php?p=10957#p10957">65SIB</a> port for interfacing with external componennts via SPI for example. This allows for expansion cards, plugin boards and other things similar to these.</li>
<li>RS-232 port will allow the PC to control the computer via serial connection using the PC's keyboard, mouse and monitor.</li>
<li>22-pin GPIO connector for other interfaces and connections like I2C or MIDI.</li>
<li>20/24-pin ATX compatible power connector to ensure a safe power supply is used.</li>
<li>Bank switched RAM will allow the user to have one bank of memory per program running.</li>
<li>Bank switched ROM means 16 programs on one EEPROM! Who doesn't want this...</li>
<li>Processor bus expansion slots. There is already a sound card available for one of these slots.</li>
